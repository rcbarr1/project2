Big question: can biological carbonate compensation act as both a positive and 
negative feedback on climate change (atmospheric pCO2 and/or temperature)?

Hypothesis:
    (+) warming-led/dominated events cause TA increase (omega increase) in
        surface ocean, increased TA export, and decreased CO2 stored in the
        ocean (AMPLIFY atmospheric pCO2)
    (-) CO2-led/dominated events cause TA decrease (omega decrease) in surface
        ocean, decreased TA export, and increased CO2 stored in the ocean 
        (MODERATE) atmospheric CO2
        
To model this: distribution of TA (shown in first project that HCO3- and CO32-
               affect CaCO3 production), CO2, and temperature

- Initial conditions of TA, pCO2, and T based on GLODAP
- Experimental forcings of pCO2 and T based on case studies of paleoclimate
- Experimental forcing of TA based on carbon dioxide removal scenario
- Natural forcings of T are atmospheric/sea surface conditions, natural
  forcings of pCO2 are atmosphere input/output of pCO2 (also base on sea
  surface?), natural forcings of TA are riverine inputs and export/burial (we
  are missing a lot of things here, do any of them matter?)
                                                                           
*Assume well-mixed atmospheric reservior exchanging CO2 with ocean
                                                                           
*Between each time step (where forcings are applied), re-equilibrate carbonate
 chemistry with CO2SYS

 Note about transport matrix set-up
 - This was designed in matlab, which uses "fortran-style" aka column major ordering
 - This means that "e" and "b" vectors (see John et al., 2020) must be constructed in this order
 - This is complicated by the fact that the land boxes are excluded from the transport matrix
 - The length of e and b vectors, as well as the length and width of the
   transport operator, are equal to the total number of ocean boxes in the model
 - Best practices: create "e" and "b" vectors in three dimensions, flatten and mask out land boxes simultaneously 
 
 - To mask and flatten simultaneously, call: 
     e_flat = e_3D[ocnmask == 1].flatten(order='F')
   
 - To unflatten and unmask simultaneously (i.e. back to 3D grid), call:
     e_3D = np.full(ocnmask.shape, np.nan)
     e_3D[ocnmask == 1] = np.reshape(e_flat, (-1,), order='F')
     
Naming convention for saving model runs (see .txt file for explanation of experiments)
    exp##__YYYY-MM-DD-a.nc (where expXX corresponds to the python file used to
    run the experiment; a, b, c etc. represent model runs from the same day)
